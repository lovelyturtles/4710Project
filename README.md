# COMP 4170 Group 4: Analysis of Parking Violations in Winnipeg 

# Abstract

In many places, the number of parking violations are growing as the population and usage of vehicles increase. These illegal parking can lead to several problems such as increased congestion, decreases safety, and it makes the cities less clean and attractive. One city that is growing is the City of Winnipeg located in Manitoba, Canada. This paper focuses on the parking violations in the City of Winnipeg and attempts to determine what factors may lead to the number of parking violations it currently has.
