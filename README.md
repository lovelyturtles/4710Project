TODO

# Abstract

In many places, the number of parking violations are growing as the population and usage of vehicles increase. These illegal parking can lead to several problems such as increased congestion, decreases safety, and it makes the cities less clean and attractive. One city that is growing is the City of Winnipeg located in Manitoba, Canada. This paper focuses on the parking violations in the City of Winnipeg and attempts to determine what factors may lead to the number of parking violations it currently has.

# Execution

## To Run Preprocessing

## To Run the Apriori Algorithm
The input file must be named "in" and be of file type ".csv" ("in.csv")

Run the apriori.py script as follows:
```
python3 apriori.py
```
It will prompt for both minimum support and minimum confidence.

It will then run (it will take some time).

The final result will be a text file called "out.txt", which will contain all frequent itemsets.
